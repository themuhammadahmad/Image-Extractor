Features:
1. It extracts all the images from the web page from the img tags and even from the background-image property as well. 
2. Every image has a button to download the image at the right -bottom corner.
2. It extracs all the cookies of the website. User can copy any of the cookie from the list just by clicking on the cookie.

List of permissions I used in manifest.json:

1. scripting
   it is used to execute any kind of script in the active tab.
